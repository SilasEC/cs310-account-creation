# CS310: Week 3 - Account Creation

## Report

For bash scripts:

1. How did you store the values used later in the confirmation?
   I stored them as named variables.
   
2. How did you create the `username` value?
   I created this by first taking in first and last name, and then concatenating those together to make a username.
